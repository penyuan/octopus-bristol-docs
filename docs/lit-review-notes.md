# Literature review notes

## meeting with Mariia 2022-11-29

### interviews

PhD students -> Pen mentioned they mostly work by themselvese

### literature review

papers can appear in multiple topics as follows: 

* lots about QRPs, quite surprised that academics reported it, 
  * a large part of the literature
  * -> we note that it's interesting Pen has only explicitly heard about it from one interview so far
  * -> sounds like we don't need much for this for the survey
* favoured topics
  * MT: It is favored topics, the only thing is about publishing significantly positive results, and not null or negative results, and journals are not interested in it. The gap is that there isn't much other than this.
* barriers
  * $$$, low-income ability to pay
  * lack of training/knowledge/mentorship
  * communication problems - between high income and low income researchers, some low income researchers don't end up on papers, called parachute research
  * time pressure/quantity of research expected means you do'nt have time to think about open research
  * lack of Internet
  * language barriers
  * some people just don't trust open access papers/journals, "something is wrong with it"
    * some assume open access journals are predatory
* bias
  * gender, women get published less
  * language bias, non-English articles are not prestiguous
  * famous names
    * both when publishing and citing
  * geographical
    * where the paper is from
  * editorial bias
    * subjectivity of editor e.g. prefer papers that confirm their opinion
* Division of labour
  * Much is on how things *should* be
    * there's a paper about three types of collaborators, and ideally a team should have all three
  * Pretty generalised
  * -> we agree this is a gap right now, though MT would like to summarise it better

* MT is finishing with 70 more papers; Also a spreadsheet from the previous attempt, will check what they did; and a few more papers to add to the Zotero library.
