# Literature review notes

## meeting with Mariia 2022-11-29

Today, we focused on getting Pen up-to-date on the literature review, then thinking about if and how the review plus interviews have addressed some of the topics proposed for the survey.

Mariia went over how the literature review spreadsheets are organised.

The papers reviewed so far often fall into different topics, and here are what Mariia has learned about those topics: 

* **Barriers**
  * Funding is the big barrier, including lack of ability to pay for those with low-income
  * Lack of training/knowledge/mentorship
  * Communication problems - between high income and low income researchers, some low income researchers don't end up on papers, called parachute research
  * Time pressure/quantity of research expected means you don't have time to think about open research
  * Lack of Internet access
  * Language barriers, and there's bias against non-English research outputs
  * Some people just don't trust open access papers/journals: "something is wrong with it"
    * And some assume open access journals are predatory
  * While barriers to doing open research seem to be well-researched, Pen thinks maybe the survey can ask respondents to score the severity of these factors, and relate that to basic demographic information about the respondents?
* **Questionable research practices (QRPs)** - quite surprised that academics reported it, 
  * A large part of the literature reviewed was about QRPs
  * We noted that it's interesting Pen has only explicitly heard about it from one interview so far
  * **Sounds like we don't need the survey to ask about QRPs since this topic is well-researched**.
* **Favoured topics**
  * The only paper found so far is about publishing significantly positive results, and not null or negative results, and journals are not interested in them. The gap is that there isn't much other than this about favoured topics.
* **Bias**
  * Gender, e.g. women get published less
  * Language bias, non-English articles are not prestiguous
  * Famous names
    * both when publishing and citing, famous names are more successful
  * Geographical
    * where the paper is from
  * Editorial bias
    * Subjectivity of editor e.g. prefer papers that confirm their opinion
* **Division of labour**
  * Much is on how things *should* be
    * There's a paper about three types of collaborators, and ideally a team should have all three
  * Pretty generalised and there isn't much on how things are *right now*.
  * We agree this is a gap right now, though Mariia would like to summarise it better
  * Note: Mariia followed up with an email on 2022-11-30 about this as follows: 
    * According to some articles collaborative activities consisted of four types of collaboration: identifying research goals, designing tasks, performing tasks, and writing reports. Team members preferred the asynchronous communication, asynchronous collaborative writing, project management, file management, and reference management tools.
    * Some researchers mentioned importance of individual’s contribution to research projects, that it could lead to more effective and more collaborative ways of working. Also it can encourage multi-institutional collaboration and help sharing information more openly.
    * As I mentioned yesterday, some articles provide suggestions how research should be done. Here are some examples.
      * “The authors focus on open research as a way to facilitate data validation and reuse, and to increase transparency through early collaboration and co-production of knowledge. Transparency and participation help build interpersonal relationships that promote multi-stakeholder dialogue between researchers and end users of conservation science to bridge the gap between knowledge and action by joining forces to address important conservation issues”.
      * “Almost all research articles include conceptualization, operationalization, and communication through writing. Deviations by discipline, however, reveal the importance of other more niche tasks, such as visualization and software, acknowledged in certain domains. These findings suggest greater heterogeneity in evaluation processes to attend to the importance of tasks by discipline. Privileging one type of labor will inevitably lead to inequities across disciplines, where specific tasks performed remain either nonperformed or unacknowledged through authorship and contributorship”.
      * “Authors define collaboration as “social processes whereby human beings pool their human capital for the objective of producing knowledge. Very large teams of specialists interact to produce research and publications and, in some cases at least, some of the collaborators never meet or even interact with one another”.
* Mariia is finishing with 70 more papers; plus going through a spreadsheet from the previous attempt, will check what they did; and a few more papers to add to the Zotero library.
