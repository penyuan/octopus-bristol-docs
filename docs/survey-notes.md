# Notes on surveys

Here's a good technique to make sure survey respondents are paying attention.

In a survey about Bristol's Clean Air Zone, one of the strongly agree -> strongly disagree questions had one called: "Please selecte 'Strongly agree' to confirm you are paying attention to these questions." Nice!
