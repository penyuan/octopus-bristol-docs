  * Alex on their mathematician and clinical practitioner contacts for interviews -> Mathematician found!
  * John about buying vouchers for interviewees
* Updated interview guide
* 7 real interviews by next Octopus meeting
* Awaiting one more physical scientist

### ACTION ITEMS

* HPY will summarise interview insights so far in preparation for meeting with Alex 2022-11-16 and for improving interview guide
  * Assess how well the questions are working
  * Which of the 7 parts are people saying lots or little useful info about?
  * What's surprising?
  * What does it say about what we could do in the survey?
* HPY will examine Lilli's suggested survey questions
  * And think about which main higher level questions to ask in the survey
  * Also, before doing all this, try to independently enumerate (along with the survey draft) the things we'd like to ask in the survey instead of just translating from interview questions
* HPY will let Merc know that JT will be tuning in for interview
* HPY will continue transcribing interviews

## post interview wrap up 2022-11-08

Time: 2022-11-08T16:40Z

Present: Jackie (JT), Pen (HPY)

We talked about tweaking the interview structure a bit, primarily in two ways: 

1. Part 1: Distribution of labour
   This is the hardest question to direct, i.e. answers are kind of all over the place and don't really break down research in the ways we had hoped i.e. problem, method, data collection, etc. So, 
   
2. Part 2: Sharing
   Interviewees tend to gravitate towards publishing papers. One additional question for this section could be: "Are papers the main form of giving credit for work?" But rather than starting with this question, let's still start with the more open-ended "What parts of the research process do researchers tend to share...", and if they only talk about papers, they follow with the question on "Are papers the main form...?"

I intend to apply this change to interviews on and after 2022-11-09.

Present: Jackie (JT), Pen (HPY)

### AGENDA

* Octopus interviews
* Planning for next week's meeting with Alex and John
* Misc

#### Octopus interviews

* Annotation strategy
  * Should ask the qualitative research people in the TARG Slack group for tips.
* At least one interviewee has requested to check their anonymised transcript
  * That's fine.

#### Planning for next week's meeting with Alex and John

* HPY gave a summary of some key observations from the interviews so far
  * Sounds good, do this again but structured to match the interview guide for a 10-min-ish summary at next week's meeting
* We also need to discuss the survey
  * And *next* month's meeting will be very important for figuring out the survey with Alex et al.

#### Misc

* HPY will likely be away 2022-12-08/09 for a meeting, but no major disruptions anticipated other than no interviews on those dates.

### ACTION ITEMS

* HPY will at least look at Lilli's proposed survey questions to understand how they could be designed, and further reflect on the draft survey
* HPY will circulate transcript with the interviewee who requested to review it
* HPY will ask TARG Slack group about tips for managing coding and annotations for interviews
