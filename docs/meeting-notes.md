# Meeting notes

## 2022-09-21

Time: 2022-09-21T16:00+01:00

Present: Pen and Jackie

* Ethics approval
  * JISC is happy to proceed per email from Lola today.
  * We went over the [Research Ethics Applications website](https://orems.bristol.ac.uk/): 
    * For anticipated end date, let's go for three years.
    * We probably don't need to run the documents by the Research Data Service this time.
    * Need to email Liam McKervey to confirm the check box for financial inducement.
    * Jackie can be listed as a collaborator and advise while Pen is the primary submitter.
* Z drive and data storage
  * Marcus is keen to utilise existing University infrastructure instead of something like the OSF.
  * This should be doable even if the most sensitive data (e.g. raw interview data) is only accessible to us with University IT access.
* We should start reaching out to our contacts - at least informally - to be ready for exactly which communities we will be surveying/interviewing.
* We should figure out how we'd like to work with Lilli while she is available
  * This will be better informed once there's a more detailed timeline and tasks...
* Work timeline
  * Prioritise deliverables, their contents and dependencies, and a breakdown of tasks
  * Temporal resolution of between a day and a week, data analyses will probably take a while
  * Keep in mind what we need the most help with from Lilli and Maria
* Scoping literature review
  * To identify what we know and don't know to inform interview/survey design
* For interview/survey methodology
  * Pen has obtained and will obtain more methods/protocols from past colleagues plus Lilli
  * Some examples are in the Z drive
  * Could start some discussion with Robbie Clark in the #meta-stream channel or in real life
  * The qualitative work will likely focus on a thematic analyses
  * For at least the initial interviews/focus groups, there would be more than one of us present with one person conducting it
  * The second chunk of work in 2023 will focus on how Octopus specifically has and will affect a researcher's workflow, how might it relate to their views on and relationship with research/other researchers, with input from Alex and Lola

## 2022-09-23

Time: 2022-09-23T15:30+01:00

Present: Pen and Jackie

* Jackie lent Pen their qualitative research handbook from Oxford
* Today's meeting focused on Pen's [draft work timeline](./timeline.md) for Octopus baseline and project evaluations through October 2023
* For the **next couple weeks**, Pen's plan is to focus on
  * The Research Ethics Application
  * Time-limited literature review
  * Time-limited review of qualitative methods
  * ... after which will move on to fleshing out the interview and survey protocols
* Also during this time, we should each reach out to our contacts listed in the spreadsheet Jackie created and establish exactly which communities we can send the survey/interview to
* A key deadline is that the **interim report has to be submitted mid-February 2023**!
  * If the interview/survey processes like recruitment and scheduling could overlap more, this should be doable...
* Research Ethics Application
  * Jackie was able to see the test application Pen created
  * Liam McKervey responded about the financial inducement check box, basically we can make the call
  * Plan is to have a complete draft application ready by approximately 2022-09-26 with any questions/concerns to discuss with Jackie
  * Goal is to submit the application mid-next week
* Interview planning
  * How to be remotely make use of Lilli's services in October 2022
    * As interview/survey protocols develop, get Lilli's critique of them
    * Do a couple practice interviews in her presence for her feedback
  * The draft interview guide is currently a pretty good view of what Alex/Lola are looking for
    * It was created from Jackie's practice interviews
  * The processes of recruiting, scheduling, and conducting the interviews could be compressed by overlapping them more
  * **Aim to have the bulk of interviews done by mid-December 2022!**
* Survey
  * This is actually less clear in terms of what we really want to look for -> Could discuss with Alex
* For 2nd half for Octopus valuation in 2023: How well is Octopus is fit for purposes for achieving its aims?
  * Should talk to people who have started using Octopus and those who haven't and introduce it to them
  * Need some feedback from Alex et al. on what they really want for this part
* Maria will be available almost full time for the first couple weeks in October 2022, and could at least help with the literature review
* Pen will be mostly away 2022-10-24/31 at the conference for the [Gathering for Open Science Hardware](https://openhardware.science/), but can ask the highly multidisciplinary researchers there about interest in the Octopus interviews/survey.
* Jackie will be physically away
  * Late November 2022 for about a week
  * Mid-December 2022 to mid-January 2023
* There is a TARG away day 2022-12-12/14

**Action items:**

* Pen will share 2022-09-23 meeting notes
* Pen will ask everyone to reach out to their contacts
* Pen will complete the Research Ethics Application by 2022-09-26 and aim to submit mid-week
* Pen will find, add, and contact the person who conducted a very similar interview for OSF about 1.5 years ago to learn from them
* Pen will set up regular meetings with Jackie
